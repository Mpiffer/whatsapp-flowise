1. "index.js" and "interface.js" - These are the names of the files that will be generated. They share a common language, JavaScript, and will likely share some common dependencies.

2. Exported Variables - These are variables that are made available for other modules to use. For example, if "index.js" exports a function or object, "interface.js" could import and use it. The names of these variables would be shared between the files.

3. Data Schemas - If the interface is interacting with a database or structured data, both files may share a common data schema. This could include names of tables, fields, or data types.

4. DOM Element IDs - If the interface is a web interface, both files may interact with the same HTML elements. The IDs of these elements would be shared between the files.

5. Message Names - If the interface uses a messaging system to communicate between different parts of the application, the names of these messages would be shared between the files.

6. Function Names - If "index.js" defines functions that "interface.js" uses, the names of these functions would be shared between the files.
